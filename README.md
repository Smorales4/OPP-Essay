The Importance of Static, Protected, and Private Access Modifiers in TypeScript

   Have you ever worked on a project where you had to manage a large and complex class hierarchy? If so, you may have encountered the use of static, protected, and private access modifiers. These modifiers are essential tools in object-oriented programming languages like TypeScript that allow us to control the visibility and accessibility of class members (properties and methods).In this essay, we will explore the concepts of static, protected, and private members and discuss why they are useful in creating a well-defined and modular class design.
    First, let's define static members. These are associated with the class itself, rather than with a specific object of the class. They can be accessed using the class name, without the need to create an object of the class. Static members are often used to create utility functions or to store data that is shared among all objects of the class.
   Next, we have protected members. These are visible and accessible within the class and its subclasses, but not from outside the class hierarchy. This is useful for creating a class hierarchy where the subclass can access and modify the protected members of the superclass, but other classes cannot.
   Finally, we have private members. These are only visible and accessible within the class in which they are declared. They cannot be accessed from outside the class, even by subclasses. Private members are often used to encapsulate implementation details and to prevent other classes from directly modifying the internal state of an object.
   So, why would we use these access modifiers? By using static, protected, and private members, we can create a clear separation between the public interface of a class and its implementation details. This helps to prevent other classes from breaking the internal logic of our class and ensures that the class is used correctly. Additionally, using these modifiers allows us to create a more maintainable and robust codebase, as we can make changes to the implementation without affecting the overall behavior of the class.
   In conclusion, static, protected, and private access modifiers are essential tools in object-oriented programming languages like TypeScript. They allow us to control the visibility and accessibility of class members and create a well-defined and modular class design. By using these modifiers, we can create a more maintainable and robust codebase that is resistant to changes in the implementation.
